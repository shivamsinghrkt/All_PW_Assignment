       <h3>1. Audio and Video Support:-</h3>
       <p>
        These two tags are launched with the release of HTML 5 and support a numerous range of attributes such as height, width,
        and more that offers developers to leverage the customization of HTML documents.
       </p>
  

       <h3>2. Canvas Elements</h3>
       <p>
        To initialize the Canvas element canvas tag is used with only two specific attributes, width and height. Once, the
        element is initialized, it is then taken care of with the help of JavaScript to draw shapes, lines, images, and
        more.
       </p>

       <h3>3. Local Storage</h3>
       <p>
        Moreover, using this feature you can reduce the transactions between the application and the backend server, creating a
        fast application. However, there are some limitations, such as there is limited storage, and you can not access more
        storage than that.
