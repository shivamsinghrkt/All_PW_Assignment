    <h1>Difference between absolute and relative</h1>
    <h3>Absolute Position:</h3>
    <p>
         An element with position: absolute; will cause it to adjust its position with respect to its parent.
        If no parent is present, then it uses the document body as parent.
        
        ex:-
        position: absolute;
    </p>

    <h3>Relative Position</h3>
    <p>
         Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of an element with position: relative; property
        will cause it to adjust from its normal position. The other objects or elements will not fill the gap.
        
      Ex:-
        
        position: relative;
    </p>
